# find a way to count words and sentences better (especially sentences)
# restrict the use of other languages

# substitution
# find a way to ensure that encrypt and decrypt select was chosen in html para d na magrerestart pag input error

# plurality
# test for bugs

# inheritance
# catch error when pressing randomize all with input
# check bug spaming randomize all errors (maybe empty alleles and bloodtype row in table every post or might fix when login sign in is made)
# work on choosing gen, and alleles
# 

# lagay logo sa navbar
# Start working on login and sign up maybe via modals nlng
# Plan out what projects are needed to be done
# mario, credit, scrabble, readability, substitution...


# upload to heroku
# remove cs50 from title
# add white bg to icon
# login required
# add search and history that shows everything the user does by looking at db
# add focus on textbox for copy clipboards in js
# add divider per week in dropdown projects 
# maybe add a way to keep entered value in form text box
# gawing table or grid ung may copy button para pantay pantay ung pwesto ng copy ?
# make all google fonts oneline by adding in the family in google fonts.com
# Try floating labels on some textbox
# Toggle dropdown similar to bootstrap website
# popovers in copy links
# add loading imagse called spinners
# add tooltip on hover of copy links
