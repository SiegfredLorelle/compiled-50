## Compiled Project Details

#### **Mario**

Mario is derived from [CS50x 2022 Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/mario/more/). This follows the 'feeling more comfortable' version of Mario. It works exactly the same as the problem set. Height is limited to 1-8 inclusive. The main difference is that the blocks are reperesented as an actual image from [Super Mario Bros](https://mario.nintendo.com/history/) in the web-app, instead of printing '#' in command line.

#### **Credit**

Credit is derived from CS50x 2022 Problem Set 1. It also works exactly the same as the problem set. It also utilizes Luhn's Algorithm to determine the validity of the card. It shows type and an image of a sample card. 

The added feature here is a 'Not sure what to enter?' dropdown. The dropdown shows sample American Express (AMEX), Mastercard, and Visa credit card numbers. Beside each credit card number is a 'copy' button. Hovering the copy button pops a tooltip saying 'copy'. Clicking the copy button automatically copy the credit card number it is assign to (or just beside it) as clipboard and automatically type the credit card number in the credit card number input box. A javascript alert informs the user about the automatic copy-paste of the credit card number.

#### **Scrabble**

Scrabble is derived from CS50x 2022 Lab 2. It works slightly different from the lab. This only asks one word from the user, instead of asking two words in the lab. It only shows the score of given word, instead of comparing the score of the two words in lab. It is also stricter in terms of accepting words. Before showing the score of the word, it verifies the validity of the world by checking it to a dictionary. The dictionary being used is the large dictionary from CS50x 2022 Week 5 Problem Set 5: Speller.
